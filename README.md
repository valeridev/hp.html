Welcome to my first repository on GitHub!

This is the homepage I created as an example of the various things I'm learning in web development. I'm excited to share my progress with you and showcase some of the skills I've acquired so far.

In this project, I've explored HTML and CSS. Additionally, I've included smooth animations, transitions, and a functional contact form. I'm excited to continue learning and adding more features to this page in the future.

This repository will serve as a record of my first homepage and also as a space to receive constructive feedback from other developers. Feel free to explore the code, make suggestions, and contribute improvements. I would love to receive your support and learn from the GitHub community.

Thank you for visiting this repository, and I hope you enjoy what I've created so far. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or suggestions.

Have fun exploring, and thank you for your support!

Sincerely,
Val
